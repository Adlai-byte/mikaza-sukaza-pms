# User Management Permissions Update

## Date
October 16, 2025

## Change Summary
Removed user management restrictions for **ops** (Operations Manager) role.

## What Changed

### Before
**Ops role permissions:**
- ❌ Could NOT view users
- ❌ Could NOT create users
- ❌ Could NOT edit users
- ❌ Could NOT delete users
- Only admins had full user management access

### After
**Ops role permissions:**
- ✅ Can view users (`USERS_VIEW`)
- ✅ Can create users (`USERS_CREATE`)
- ✅ Can edit users (`USERS_EDIT`)
- ✅ Can delete users (`USERS_DELETE`)
- ❌ Cannot change user roles (`USERS_CHANGE_ROLE` - admin only for security)

## Security Considerations

### What Ops CAN Do
- View all users in the system
- Create new user accounts
- Edit user details (name, email, phone, etc.)
- Delete user accounts
- Change user passwords
- Suspend/Archive/Reactivate users (if Phase 2 features enabled)
- View user bank accounts and credit cards
- Manage user status (active/inactive)

### What Ops CANNOT Do
- **Change user roles** (admin → ops or vice versa)
  - This prevents privilege escalation
  - Only admins can promote/demote users
  - Security best practice

### Why This Makes Sense
Operations Managers need to:
1. Create accounts for new property owners
2. Update client contact information
3. Manage user access when clients leave
4. Handle day-to-day user support requests

Preventing role changes ensures ops users cannot:
- Give themselves admin privileges
- Demote admins to ops
- Bypass the permission system

## Files Modified

**File:** `src/lib/rbac/permissions.ts`

**Lines:** 148-164

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
ops: {
  name: 'Operations Manager',
  description: 'Property and operations management - limited access to finance and user management',
  permissions: [
    // No user permissions
    PERMISSIONS.PROPERTIES_VIEW,
    // ...
  ]
}

// AFTER
ops: {
  name: 'Operations Manager',
  description: 'Property and operations management - can view and manage users',
  permissions: [
    // ========== USERS - Full access ==========
    PERMISSIONS.USERS_VIEW,
    PERMISSIONS.USERS_CREATE,
    PERMISSIONS.USERS_EDIT,
    PERMISSIONS.USERS_DELETE,
    // NOT: USERS_CHANGE_ROLE (admin only - prevents privilege escalation)

    PERMISSIONS.PROPERTIES_VIEW,
    // ...
  ]
}
```

## Impact

### Who This Affects
- **Ops users**: Now have full user management access
- **Admin users**: No change (already had access)

### Where This Appears
- **User Management page** (`/users`): Ops can now access
- **Sidebar navigation**: "User Management" link now visible to ops
- **Protected routes**: `/users` route now accessible to ops
- **User actions**: All CRUD operations available to ops (except role changes)

## Testing

### Test as Ops User

1. **Navigation**
   - ✅ "User Management" link visible in sidebar
   - ✅ Can click and navigate to `/users`
   - ✅ No "Access Denied" error

2. **View Users**
   - ✅ Can see user list
   - ✅ Can view user details
   - ✅ Can see all user data

3. **Create User**
   - ✅ "Add User" button visible
   - ✅ Can open user form
   - ✅ Can create new user
   - ✅ User appears in list

4. **Edit User**
   - ✅ Can click edit on any user
   - ✅ Can modify user details
   - ✅ Changes save successfully

5. **Delete User**
   - ✅ Can click delete on any user
   - ✅ Confirmation dialog appears
   - ✅ User is deleted

6. **Role Changes** (Should Fail)
   - ❌ Cannot see role change option (if UI properly implements check)
   - ❌ API rejects role change if attempted

## Permission Matrix

| Permission | Admin | Ops |
|------------|-------|-----|
| View Users | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Users | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit Users | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete Users | ✅ | ✅ |
| Change User Roles | ✅ | ❌ |

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert this change:

1. Open `src/lib/rbac/permissions.ts`
2. Remove lines 152-157:
   ```typescript
   // ========== USERS - Full access ==========
   PERMISSIONS.USERS_VIEW,
   PERMISSIONS.USERS_CREATE,
   PERMISSIONS.USERS_EDIT,
   PERMISSIONS.USERS_DELETE,
   // NOT: USERS_CHANGE_ROLE (admin only - prevents privilege escalation)
   ```
3. Change description back to:
   ```typescript
   description: 'Property and operations management - limited access to finance and user management',
   ```
4. Save and refresh browser

## Related Permissions Still Restricted for Ops

The following remain **admin-only**:
- `SYSTEM_SETTINGS` - System configuration
- `SYSTEM_LOGS` - System logs
- `SYSTEM_AUDIT` - Audit trails
- `USERS_CHANGE_ROLE` - Role management
- `PROPERTIES_DELETE` - Property deletion
- Most finance editing/creating/deleting
- Employee document management
- Document approval workflows
- Custom reports

## Implementation Status

✅ **Complete and Ready**

Ops users can now fully manage users in the system while admins retain exclusive control over user roles and system settings.

## Notes

- This change is **backwards compatible** - no breaking changes
- No database migrations required
- No UI changes required (existing permission checks will work)
- Changes take effect immediately after file save
- Users may need to refresh their browser to see changes
