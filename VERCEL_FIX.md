# Vercel Deployment Fix - React Leaflet Version Conflict

**Date:** January 12, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem

Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:

```
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^19.0.0" from react-leaflet@5.0.0
npm error node_modules/react-leaflet
npm error   react-leaflet@"^5.0.0" from the root project

npm error Conflicting peer dependency: react@19.2.0
```

### Root Cause

- Project uses **React 18.3.1**
- `react-leaflet@5.0.0` requires **React 19.x**
- Version mismatch caused peer dependency conflict
- All Radix UI components are designed for React 18

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Downgraded react-leaflet from v5.0.0 to v4.2.1**

### Changes Made:

**File:** `package.json` (line 62)

```diff
- "react-leaflet": "^5.0.0",
+ "react-leaflet": "^4.2.1",
```

### Why This Version?

- ✅ React Leaflet v4.2.1 is compatible with React 18
- ✅ Stable and well-tested release
- ✅ No breaking changes for existing map components
- ✅ Maintains all functionality used in the app

## 📝 React Leaflet v4 vs v5

### What's Different:

**v5.0.0 (Requires React 19):**
- Modern React features
- Requires React 19.x
- Not compatible with our stack

**v4.2.1 (Works with React 18):**
- Stable and mature
- Full React 18 support
- All map features we use
- Compatible with Radix UI components

### What Stays the Same:

✅ All map functionality
✅ Leaflet integration
✅ Marker support
✅ TileLayer support
✅ MapContainer API
✅ All our existing map code works unchanged

## 🔮 Future Upgrade Path

### When to Upgrade to React 19:

Wait until these are ready:
- [ ] All Radix UI components support React 19
- [ ] All dependencies tested with React 19
- [ ] React 19 is stable (not RC)
- [ ] Team is ready for migration

### Then:
1. Upgrade React to v19
2. Upgrade react-leaflet to v5
3. Test all components
4. Deploy

**Estimated Timeline:** Q2 2025 or later
