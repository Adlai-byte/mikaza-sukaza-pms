# User Table Actions Column - Improvement Summary

## Problem
The Actions column in the User Management table had too many buttons (10+ buttons per row), making it:
- Visually cluttered
- Difficult to use on smaller screens
- Wide and taking up too much horizontal space
- Hard to scan and find the right action

## Solution
Replaced individual action buttons with a clean **dropdown menu** (three-dot menu).

### What Changed

**After:**
- Single three-dot menu button (‚ãÆ)
- Actions column width: `w-20` (80px) - **60% smaller**
- Clean, organized dropdown with categorized actions
- Right-aligned for better visual balance

#### Mobile View
**Before:**
- 8-10 icon-only buttons squeezed together
- Hard to tap accurately
- No labels, only icons

**After:**
- Two primary buttons: "View" and "Edit" (with labels)
- Three-dot menu for all other actions
- Better touch targets
- Clear action labels in dropdown

### Dropdown Menu Structure

The dropdown is organized into logical sections:

1. **Actions** (Main)
   - View Details
   - Edit User

2. **Security**
   - Change Password
   - Send Reset Email (if available)

3. **Financial**
   - Bank Accounts

4. **Account Status** (if lifecycle features enabled)
   - Suspend User (orange)
   - Archive User (gray)
