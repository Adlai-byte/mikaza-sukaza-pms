## Test 3: File Upload Validation

### Setup
1. Log in as any user (Admin or Ops)
2. Navigate to Issues page
3. Create or edit an issue

### Test Case 1: Valid Image Upload ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Click "Upload Photo" or similar
2. Select a valid image file:
   - `.jpg` or `.jpeg` (< 5MB)
   - `.png` (< 5MB)
   - `.webp` (< 5MB)
3. Upload the file

**Expected Result:**
- File uploads successfully
- Console shows: `‚úÖ File validation passed`
- Photo appears in the issue

### Test Case 2: Invalid File Type ‚ùå

**Steps:**
1. Try uploading an executable file:
   - `.exe`
   - `.bat`
   - `.sh`
   - `.js`
   - `.zip`
2. Attempt to upload

**Expected Result:**
- Upload fails immediately
- Error message: "Dangerous file type detected"
- Console shows: `‚ùå File validation failed: Dangerous file type detected: .exe. Executable files are not allowed for security reasons.`
- File is NOT uploaded to Supabase Storage

### Test Case 3: Oversized File ‚ùå

**Steps:**
1. Try uploading an image larger than 5MB
2. Attempt to upload

**Expected Result:**
- Upload fails
- Error message: "File size (X MB) exceeds maximum allowed size (5.00MB)"
- Console shows: `‚ùå File validation failed`
- File is NOT uploaded

### Test Case 4: File with Double Extension ‚ùå

**Steps:**
1. Rename a file to have double extension:
   - `photo.jpg.exe`
   - `image.png.bat`
2. Try uploading

**Expected Result:**
- Upload fails
- Error message: "Suspicious file name detected. File appears to have a hidden executable extension."
- File is NOT uploaded

### Test Case 5: File with Invalid Characters ‚ùå

**Steps:**
1. Rename a file with special characters:
   - `photo<script>.jpg`
   - `image|test.png`
2. Try uploading

**Expected Result:**
- Upload fails
- Error message: "File name contains invalid characters"
- File is NOT uploaded

### Test Case 6: Very Small File (Warning) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Steps:**
1. Upload a very small file (< 100 bytes)
2. Upload the file

**Expected Result:**
- File uploads (validation passes)
- Console warning: `‚ö†Ô∏è File validation warnings: File is very small (< 100 bytes). It may be corrupted or empty.`
- File is uploaded but with a warning

### Check Console Logs

Open browser console and look for:
```
üîç Validating issue photo upload...
üîç Validating file: photo.jpg (ISSUE_PHOTO)
‚úÖ File validation passed
```

Or on failure:
```
üîç Validating issue photo upload...
üîç Validating file: malware.exe (ISSUE_PHOTO)
‚ùå Dangerous file detected: [Dangerous file type detected: .exe...]
‚ùå File validation failed: Dangerous file type detected...
```

### Pass Criteria
- ‚úÖ Valid images (.jpg, .png, .webp < 5MB) upload successfully
- ‚úÖ Executable files (.exe, .bat, .sh, etc.) are blocked
- ‚úÖ Oversized files (> 5MB) are blocked
- ‚úÖ Files with double extensions are blocked
- ‚úÖ Files with invalid characters are blocked
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages shown to user
- ‚úÖ Console logs show validation details

## Test 4: Query Performance

### Setup
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"

### Test Case 1: Booking Conflict Detection

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar or Bookings page
2. Try to create a new booking that overlaps with an existing one
3. Watch the Network tab for queries to Supabase

**Expected Result:**
- Query to check booking conflicts completes in < 20ms
- Previously: ~200ms (10-20x improvement)

**Check Query Plan (in Supabase SQL Editor):**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM property_bookings
WHERE property_id = 'your-property-id'
  AND booking_status != 'cancelled'
  AND check_in_date <= '2024-12-31'
  AND check_out_date >= '2024-12-01';
```

**Expected:** Should show `Index Scan using idx_bookings_property_dates_status`

### Test Case 2: Task List Loading

**Steps:**
1. Log in as Ops user
2. Navigate to Tasks/Todos page
3. Watch Network tab for the tasks query

**Expected Result:**
- Query completes in < 15ms
- Previously: ~150ms (10-15x improvement)

### Test Case 3: Calendar Rendering

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar page
2. Watch Network tab for booking queries
3. Note the total page load time

**Expected Result:**
- Calendar loads 30-50% faster than before
- All booking queries use indexes
- Total render time significantly reduced

### Test Case 4: User List Caching (React Query)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to any page that loads users (Jobs, Tasks, Issues)
2. Watch Network tab
3. Navigate away and come back within 30 minutes
4. Watch Network tab again

**Expected Result:**
- First load: Query to Supabase (fetches users)
- Second load (within 30 min): No query (served from cache)
- Console shows: `useUsersOptimized: Using cached data`

### Pass Criteria
- ‚úÖ Booking queries < 20ms (was ~200ms)
- ‚úÖ Task queries < 15ms (was ~150ms)
- ‚úÖ Query plans show index usage
- ‚úÖ User list cached for 30 minutes
- ‚úÖ Noticeable performance improvement in UI

---

## Test 5: Index Usage Verification

### Run After 1-2 Days of Testing

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Check index usage statistics
SELECT
  tablename,
  indexname,
  idx_scan as times_used,
  idx_tup_read as tuples_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Indexes should show `times_used > 0`
- Most used indexes should be:
  - `idx_bookings_property_dates_status`
  - `idx_tasks_assigned_status`
  - `idx_jobs_property_status`
  - `idx_issues_property_status`

**Find Unused Indexes:**

```sql
-- Find indexes that haven't been used
SELECT
  tablename,
  indexname,
  idx_scan
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND idx_scan = 0
  AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Action:** If any indexes show 0 usage after 1 week, consider removing them to save storage.

## Test 6: Security Edge Cases

### Test Case 1: Unauthenticated Access

**Steps:**
1. Log out of the application
2. Try accessing `/properties`, `/bookings`, `/jobs` directly

**Expected Result:**
- Redirected to login page
- No data visible
- RLS blocks all access

### Test Case 2: Role Escalation Attempt

**Steps:**
1. Log in as Ops user
2. Open browser console
3. Try to manually call a protected mutation:

```javascript
// Try to delete a property (Ops should not be able to)
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('properties')
  .delete()
  .eq('property_id', 'some-id');

console.log(error); // Should show permission error
```

**Expected Result:**
- Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"
- Property is NOT deleted
- RLS blocks the operation at database level

### Test Case 3: JWT Tampering Protection

**Steps:**
1. Log in as Ops user
2. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Try to modify the JWT token to change `user_type` to `admin`
4. Try accessing admin-only features

**Expected Result:**
- Supabase validates the JWT signature
- Modified token is rejected
- User remains as Ops (cannot escalate to Admin)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Permission denied for table X"

**Cause:** RLS is blocking access

**Fix:**
1. Check user role is set correctly: `SELECT user_type FROM users WHERE user_id = auth.uid();`
2. Verify JWT claims include `user_type`
3. Check RLS policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'X';`

### Issue 2: Queries Still Slow After Indexes

**Cause:** Query planner statistics not updated

**Fix:**
```sql
ANALYZE property_bookings;
ANALYZE tasks;
ANALYZE jobs;
-- Run for all tables with new indexes
```

### Issue 3: File Upload Validation Not Working

**Cause:** Import missing or function not called

**Fix:** Verify in component:
```typescript
import { validateFile } from '@/lib/file-validation';

const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const result = await validateFile(file, 'ISSUE_PHOTO');
  if (!result.isValid) {
    alert(result.errors.join('. '));
    return;
  }
  // Proceed with upload
};
```
