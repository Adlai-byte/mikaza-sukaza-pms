## üêõ If Something Fails

### OPS User Can't Create Tasks
**Check:**
- Is the user's `user_type` set to `'ops'` in database?
- Did you refresh the page after I updated the permissions?
- Try logging out and back in

### Date Field Errors
**Check:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check browser console for errors

### Notifications Not Appearing
**Check:**
1. **Open browser console (F12)** - Look for:
   - `‚úÖ Notification created for task assignment` (success)
   - `‚ùå Failed to create notification: [error]` (failure)
   - Any errors from Supabase

2. **If you see ‚úÖ but no notification in bell:**
   - Check real-time subscription is working
   - Look for `üîî Notification update:` logs in console
   - Refresh the page as the assigned user
   - Check Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí notifications table

3. **If you see ‚ùå error:**
   - Read the error message in console
   - Likely a permission or database issue
   - Check RLS policies on `notifications` table

4. **Manually create a test notification:**
   - In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor, run:
```sql
-- Get your user_id first
SELECT user_id, first_name FROM users LIMIT 5;

-- Create test (replace YOUR_USER_ID)
INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, type, title, message, link)
VALUES (
    'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid,
    'task_assigned',
    'Manual Test',
    'This is a manual test notification',
    '/todos'
);
```

If manual notification appears in the bell, then the notification creation code is the issue.
