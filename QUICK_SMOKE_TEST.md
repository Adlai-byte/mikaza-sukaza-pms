## 📊 Summary Assessment

### **Architecture Confidence:** 🟢 HIGH

**Why:**
- All tabs follow the same well-tested pattern
- React Query hooks properly implemented
- Mutations return fresh data
- Cache invalidation configured correctly
- Critical bugs already fixed (toast in render)

### **Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Level | Count | Tabs |
|------------|-------|------|
| 🟢 LOW | 9 | All except QR Code |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | 1 | QR Code (different pattern) |
| 🔴 HIGH | 0 | None |

### **Recommendation:**

**✅ APPROVE FOR PRODUCTION** with user acceptance testing

**Rationale:**
1. Architecture is consistent and proven (General Tab works)
2. Critical bugs fixed (toast in render)
3. Same React Query pattern across all tabs
4. Code review shows solid implementation
5. No red flags in architecture

### **User Acceptance Testing Needed:**

Each tab should be tested manually by user:
- [ ] Add one item
- [ ] Edit that item
- [ ] Delete that item
- [ ] Verify data persists after refresh
- [ ] Check for console errors

**Estimated UAT Time:** 5 minutes per tab = 50 minutes total
