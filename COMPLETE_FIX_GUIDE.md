## üöÄ Action Items Required (In Order)

### Step 1: Run RLS Disable Migration ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250114_disable_rls_for_dev.sql`

**What it does:** Disables Row Level Security on all tables so data can load

**How to run:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire contents of `20250114_disable_rls_for_dev.sql`
6. Paste and click **Run**

**Expected result:**
```
RLS disabled for all existing tables in development mode
WARNING: This is for DEVELOPMENT ONLY. Enable RLS for production!
```

---

### Step 2: Fix User Role Case Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**File:** `FIX_USER_TYPE_CASE.sql`

**What it does:** Converts "Administrator" ‚Üí "admin" and "Ops" ‚Üí "ops"

**How to run:**
1. In Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run this query:

```sql
-- Fix user_type case
UPDATE users
SET user_type = CASE
    WHEN user_type IN ('Administrator', 'ADMIN', 'Admin') THEN 'admin'
    WHEN user_type IN ('Ops', 'OPS', 'Operations') THEN 'ops'
    ELSE LOWER(user_type)
END;

UPDATE profiles
SET user_type = CASE
    WHEN user_type IN ('Administrator', 'ADMIN', 'Admin') THEN 'admin'
    WHEN user_type IN ('Ops', 'OPS', 'Operations') THEN 'ops'
    ELSE LOWER(user_type)
END;

-- Verify
SELECT user_type, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY user_type;
```

**Expected result:**
```
user_type | count
----------|------
admin     | X
ops       | Y
```

---

### Step 3: Log Out and Log Back In ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

**Why:** Your session needs to refresh with the correct lowercase role

**How:**
1. Click your profile/avatar
2. Click **Sign Out**
3. Go to login page
4. Log back in with your credentials

**What will change:** You'll now have access to User Management page

---

### Step 4: Run User Lifecycle Migration (Optional)

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250116_add_user_lifecycle_management.sql`

**What it does:** Adds suspend, archive, and last login tracking features

**How to run:**
1. In Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `20250116_add_user_lifecycle_management.sql`
3. Paste and run

**Features this enables:**
- Suspend user accounts
- Archive user accounts
- Track last login
- Reactivate suspended/archived users

**Note:** This is optional but recommended for Phase 2 features

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. RLS Disable Migration (Complete Rewrite)

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250114_disable_rls_for_dev.sql`

**Changes:**
- Now uses `DO $$ ... END $$` blocks with existence checks
- Won't fail if tables don't exist (like bookings)
- Grants permissions dynamically only to existing tables
- Includes all necessary tables: users, profiles, properties, jobs, tasks, issues, etc.

**Before:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.bookings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ‚ùå Error if bookings doesn't exist
```

**After:**
```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'bookings') THEN
        ALTER TABLE public.bookings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    END IF;
END $$;
-- ‚úÖ Safe - skips if table doesn't exist
```

---

### 2. User Role Case Fix

**File:** `FIX_USER_TYPE_CASE.sql` (new)

**Problem:** Database had "Administrator", RBAC expects "admin"

**Solution:** SQL script to convert all role names to lowercase

**Impact:** Fixes "Access Denied" error for User Management

---

### 3. Profile Picture Upload

**File:** `src/pages/Profile.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added file validation using `validateFile()` from `@/lib/file-validation`
- ‚úÖ Security checks (file type, size, magic numbers, dangerous files)
- ‚úÖ Loading state with spinner
- ‚úÖ Better error messages
- ‚úÖ Updates both `users` table and AuthContext
- ‚úÖ Resets file input after upload

**Security Features:**
- Max 5MB file size
- Images only (JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP, SVG)
- Magic number validation (prevents fake extensions)
- Dangerous file detection (blocks executables)
- MIME type checking
- Filename sanitization

---

### 4. UserManagement Metric Cards

**File:** `src/pages/UserManagement.tsx` (lines 171-252)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Gradient backgrounds matching Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Colored icon badges (blue, green, purple, orange)
- ‚úÖ Large 3xl numbers
- ‚úÖ Hover effects (shadow + scale-up)
- ‚úÖ Loading states
- ‚úÖ Additional context text

**Design Tokens:**
```tsx
// Total Users - Blue
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-blue-100"

// Active Users - Green
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-50 to-green-100"

// Admins - Purple
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-50 to-purple-100"

// Ops Team - Orange
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-50 to-orange-100"
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting "Access Denied" after Step 2

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT user_type, email FROM users WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

Should show `user_type = 'admin'` (lowercase)

**Fix:** Make sure you logged out and back in (Step 3)

---

### Issue: Properties load but Users still don't

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename IN ('users', 'properties');
```

Should show both with `rowsecurity = false`

**Fix:** Re-run Step 1 migration

---

### Issue: Profile picture uploads but doesn't show

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Supabase Storage bucket exists: `property-images`
3. Bucket is public
4. File was actually uploaded (check Storage in Supabase)

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check if photo_url was updated
SELECT user_id, email, photo_url FROM users WHERE photo_url IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### Issue: Migration fails with "permission denied"

**Fix:** Make sure you're logged into Supabase Dashboard as project owner

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Development vs Production

**Current State:** Development mode with RLS disabled

**Before Production:**
1. ‚ùå DO NOT deploy with RLS disabled
2. ‚úÖ Enable RLS on all tables
3. ‚úÖ Implement proper RLS policies
4. ‚úÖ Test with different user roles
5. ‚úÖ See: `supabase/migrations/20251005000000_add_rbac_rls_policies.sql`

### Security Considerations

**RLS Disabled Risks:**
- Any authenticated user can access all data
- No row-level restrictions
- Only suitable for development

**Mitigation:**
- Use only in development environment
- Enable RLS before production
- Review and test RLS policies thoroughly

---

## üìà Next Steps (Optional)

### Phase 2: User Lifecycle Management

If you ran the optional migration (Step 4), you now have:

**New Features:**
- Suspend user accounts (temporary block)
- Archive user accounts (soft delete)
- Track last login timestamps
- Reactivate suspended/archived users
- View inactive users (90+ days)

**UI Access:**
- User Management page ‚Üí Action buttons for each user
- Suspend button (üö´ Ban icon, orange)
- Archive button (üì¶ Archive icon, gray)
- Reactivate button (‚úÖ CheckCircle icon, green)

**See:** `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for full documentation

---

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements

**Recommended:**
1. Enable RLS with proper policies
2. Add bulk user operations
3. Implement 2FA for admins
4. Add email notifications for status changes
5. Create compliance reports
6. Add user activity dashboard
